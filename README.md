# Fitprime Labs Career FrameworkÂ ðŸ§ª

<aside>
ðŸš§ Â *This document will be in continuous development as the company evolves.*

</aside>

### What is this?Â ðŸ”¦

This document aims to be a simple framework to define the career path of each member of the Fitprime Labs team. Our objective is to be fully transparent about:

- what we expect from each team member
- what are the possible growth path inside the team

It is our guide on evaluating both the career evolution of our team members and the job posting for new candidates. It is also an important support for our team members to self-assess and have a clear vision of the current or future position in Fitprime.

### How it works?

At the moment it is very simple. It is based on 3 keys:

1. **Roles**: we have defined different role categories.
2. **Skills**: there are several skill categories, each with specific knowledge for each role category.
3. **Levels**: each role has a scale of levels based on skills and expectations.

---

## Available Role Categories

Roles are based on the current technology stack and on the internal product development strategy. At the moment, there are:

- Front-end Web Developer
- Back-end Developer
- Native Mobile Developer
- Product Designer

## Skill categories

There are many categories of skill that will have specific knowledge/experience in each role (where applicable):

- **Programming Basics:** language syntax, data structures, data manipulation. Plus, specific know-how for the specific developer field.
- **Specific Knowledge :** specific know-how and best practices of a given field.
- **Tools: g**eneral development tools, GIT, command lineâ€¦
- **Frameworks: k**now-how and experience of one or more specific frameworks that will be used for our projects.
- **Best Practices: p**atterns, principles, tools and general best practices.
- **Problem Solving: a**utonomously search & find solutions, effective debug skills, help the team
- **Team Communication: a**bility to communicate effectively and work efficiently with other team members
- **Non technical communication: a**bility to communicate and work with stakeholders and other teams, understand needs and explain technical topics in an understandable but effective way
- **Project ownership & accountability:** own a project responsibility and be entirely accountable and autonomous about its realization and maintenance
- **Mentorship: m**entor junior teammates on hard and soft skills

## Technical Skill Details

## Upgrades and Years of Experience

For each level of the following table there will be a minimum number of years of experience in order to unlock the upgrade from a level to another.

Anyway, both when on-boarding new team members and when evaluating upgrades, it will have a relative weight: we will always focus on a good mix of the soft and hard skills defined in the previous sections.

# Full-stack Roles

Our philosophy is based on the vision of a small, highly-committed and quality oriented team, where generalists and full-stack developers can give a lot of value.

For this reason, team members with horizontal skills will be able to have custom roles and responsibilities and the chance to have a salary up to 1 bonus level.
